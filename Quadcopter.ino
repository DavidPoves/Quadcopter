/*
 * This is the main script for the Quadcopter project. Before uploading the code,
 * read the instructions below:
 * 0. Modify pins at which motors, optical sensors and IMU will be connected in Pins.h
 * 1. If your motors require of calibration, change REQUIRE_CALIBRATION in MotorSetup.h
 *    to true.
 * 2. Either if your motors are calibrated or not, the user may change the
 *    minimum and maximum pulse widths as desired in MotorSetup.h by changing the
 *    values of MIN_PULSE_LENGTH and MAX_PULSE_LENGTH. If your motors are calibrated
 *    under some other values, change these variables as required. If your motors are
 *    not calibrated, these variables may be changed by user requirements.
 * 3. If calibration is required, follow the instructions given on screen. Otherwise,
 *    proceed with the execution.
 * 4. At this point, motors will start rotating in a given sequence at minimum
 *    throttle.
 * 5. Next, the IMU is initialized. At this point the serial monitor should already
 *    be opened to follow instructions.
 * 6. If no IMU calibration is found on Arduino's EEPROM, the user may follow the
 *    instructions given in:
 *    https://es.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/arduinoio/ug/calibrate-sensors.html
 *    The code will automatically stop the calibration once the full process is done.
 *    The calibration profile will be saved. If a calibration profile is found,
 *    the IMU may require to slightly move the device to calibrate the magnetometer.
 * 7. Optical Sensors are initialized.
